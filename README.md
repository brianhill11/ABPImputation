# ABPImputation

ABPImputation is a package for imputing the arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform using non-invasive physiological waveforms (photoplethysmogram, or PPG, and electrocardiogram, or ECG/EKG). 
For detailed information, please see our paper: [Imputation of the continuous arterial line 
blood pressure waveform from non-invasive measurements using deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94913-y).

## Installation

### From Github repo 
Clone the repo and install the required packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/brianhill11/ABPImputation.git
cd ABPImputation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

## Data download

The preprocessed MIMIC .npy files can be downloaded [here](https://app.box.com/s/ij8ieao7h0ustwd43oiuz2207m9s7mxh).

Files containing train/validation/test patient IDs can be found in the [abpimputation/data/metadata](abpimputation/data/metadata) directory.

## Data format 

We assume that the input waveform data has been sampled at 100 Hz. 

The raw data should be in the following format: 
```
,ekg,ppg,art,pseudo_NIBP_sys_5min,pseudo_NIBP_dias_5min,pseudo_NIBP_mean_5min

```

The first column is the timestamp index, which is assumed to be in sorted order. 
Column names for each signal must either be 'ekg' for electrocardiogram, 
'ppg' for photoplethysmogram, and 
'art' (if available) for arteral line blood pressure, or they should be mapped to such 
using the `signal_column_names` dict in the [project_configs.py](abpimputation/project_configs.py) file. 

Non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) columns should be specified using the `nibp_column_names` variable 
in the [project_configs.py](abpimputation/project_configs.py) file, using the order: systolic, diastolic, mean. 


## Preprocessing

## Generating predictions with pre-trained model

Generating predictions using the pre-trained model generally
requires 3 steps: 

1. loading waveform data (in the expected format, see [Data format section](#data-format))
2. preprocessing the waveform data to add additional features
3. load the pre-trained model and generated the imputed waveform(s)

Here is an example code segment:

```python
from abpimputation.ABPImputer import ABPImputer
from abpimputation.preprocessing.preprocess import preprocess

# read in the data from file
data = pd.read_csv(f, index_col=0)

# preprocess the data 
preprocessed_data = preprocess(data)

# split into input/target data
y_true = preprocessed_data["art"]
X = preprocessed_data.iloc[:, :-1]
# add in pseudo-time axis 
X = np.expand_dims(X, axis=1)

# instantiate ABPImputer
abp = ABPImputer()

# generate predicted ABP waveform
y_pred = abp.predict(X)
```

## Calibrating the model using additional data

## Training from scratch
